# Functional Data Structures

This is a project that aims to help understand how funtional
data structures work.

If you ever wonder how memory was reused in immutable data
structures, this may help you :)

Right now, the initial version only supports Stack
(the easy one I know), but I expect to add more soon.

## Tech stuff

This project is build with [elm](https://elm-lang.org/), as a single
page app, and uses [Viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) to render
the graphs.

## Contributing

Feel free to open an issue if you find a bug or you have a suggestion.

Proper build instructions coming soon, but the (untested) Makefile
should be a good start.
